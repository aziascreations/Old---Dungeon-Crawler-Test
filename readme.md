# Dungeon Crawler - Command Test 01

## Description

This an old project from late 2013/early 2014 that I worked on while I was still learning the basics of Java and programming in general.<br>
I wrote it without knowing what [OOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) was and it really shows throughout the project.

I decided to post it to be able to remember how bad I was and how I "evolved" since.<br>
And to show it to some people as well, I might as well laugh from it than hide it.

## Notes

The main class is: azias.game.dungeoncrawler.Start
